Recaman's Sequence

This is a Python program which gives the image of a number n following Recaman's Sequence. It is currently very slow and inneficient, but it is the only way I've found to do it.
I hope to be able to make it more efficient in the future, as I learn more about algorithms and coding in general. All help is appreciated ;)
